# World-Food-Report

### Overview
This project analyzes global food data to uncover trends, disparities, and patterns in food production. The interactive Power BI dashboard provides visual insights into the state of world food systems, helping policymakers, researchers, and organizations make data-driven decisions about food security and agricultural development.

### Key Questions Asked
1. How has global food production changed over the past decade?
2. Top producing continents over the past decade. 
3. Top 5 countries by their production quantity. 
4. What will be the production quantity over the next decade?

### Tools Used
- Primary Tool: Microsoft Power BI (for visualization and analysis)
- Data Sources: 
  FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) datasets
- Data Preparation: Power Query in Power BI, Excel
- Version Control: GitHub for project documentation and file sharing

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
1. Data Collection:
   - Compiled datasets from FAO sources into a unified structure

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values using appropriate imputation methods
   - Standardized country names across datasets
   - Converted all measurements to consistent units
   - Removed duplicate entries

3. Data Modeling:
   - Established relationships between fact and dimension tables
   - Created measures using DAX for advanced calculations
   - Implemented star schema for optimal performance

### Key Insights
 • China Mainland leads the world in countries with the highest production quantity of 27bn and c followed by Brazil with 24bn.

 • Results showed a forecast that production quantity in 2032 could rise to 0.74bn that’s 7.4 million. 

 • Asia leads the continents of the world that has the highest production quantity.

### Recommendations
1. Policy Recommendations:
   - Targeted interventions for the 15 countries with worsening food security
   
2. Agricultural Development:
   - Increased investment in climate-resilient crops for vulnerable regions
   - Support for smallholder farmers in middle-income countries showing efficient models

3. Data Improvements:
   - More frequent data collection in rapidly urbanizing areas
